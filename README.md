This repository currently includes visualizations made with:
- Python (.ipynb)
- R (.rmd)

# Interactive tutorials
Both Python tutorials are directly available through Binder. Click on the Binder launcher to open them!

# Background
The idea behind the ‘open-visualizations’ repository stems from the fact that (open) science - in general - lacks ‘fully’ transparent and robust visualizations, i.e., figures have always some form of ‘hidden-data’. To overcome this issue, I created this repository. Some of the work in R is inspired by work from Allen et al. (2019)(https://github.com/RainCloudPlots/RainCloudPlots)

I hope that these tutorials are helpful for your research!
